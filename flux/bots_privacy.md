## Information Collection and Use

For providing features and better experience, while using our Service, we may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to FluxTeam.

We may collect these information while you use the Service:

* **User ID**<br>
  This is used to link other data to you, so we can know which data belongs to which user.

* **Message Content**<br>
  This is used to check if you typed a valid command or not, however Message Contents are not stored on our servers unless if you don't use a feature of Service that requires collecting the message content (such as chat-based games)

* **Channel ID**<br>
  Channel ID is used in Service configuration such as knowing which channel is marked as "log channel", "game channel".

* **Server ID**<br>
  Server ID is used to save Service configuration, so Service can know which configuration belongs to which server.

* **Profile Picture**<br>
  To use features that requires your profile picture appears such as "scoreboard" or "avatar command", we may store your current profile picture temporarily in our cache to decrease the API calls. As it is temporary, it will be deleted automatically from our servers after some amount of the time.

## Log Data

We want to inform you that whenever you use our Service, in a case of an error in the Service we collect data and information (through third party products) called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as partial message content, the time and date of your use of the Service, ID of your account, server and channel and other statistics.

## Security

We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Links to Other Sites

Therefore, we strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
